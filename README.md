# Facial-Landmark-using-dlib
this method put landmark on face so ,we can easily track the feature of face using dlib.
Download Shape Tracker file Using This Link:
"TensorFace/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat"
after That put that file into:
predictor_path= "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat"
it also works for multiple detected faces and also put points to every face.
Thats work fine
